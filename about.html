                  <h3><strong>A delve into the History</h3><p><br><br>Luxury Boutique had a long start, and a rough one. Opening a fashion boutique in the 1050s meant competition - and lots of it - for the latest and greatest trends the world had to offer. At first there wasn't a lot of business in such a saturated market, and many styles came and went (such a floral, the Boutique's best but shortest lived trend to this day) before the company came into the spotlight.

                    Following a fire at one of Luxury Boutqiue's stores in 1999, the company reached its lowest point just a year before its 50th annaversary. The loss of funds and trust from the customer base was devistating, and job stability within the company plummeted too as managers scremabled to remedy the problems they beleived could be fixed with newer, fresher faces on the shop floor. This, however, was not the case. As 2000 rolled around, the celebrations were dismal and flew under the public radar after twenty years of fame. 
                    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                    In 2003, one branch of Luxury Boutique took the leap into E-commerce in a last-ditch attempt to save the flagging brand. If the founders of the company had galled at the competition and saturated markets of the 1950s, they wouldn't have believed the scramble for clicks and views that was the internet. However, thanks in part to an appereance of one of Luxury Boutique's dresses on the red carpet, interactions soared. Soon there was a major push towards digital sales company-wide, and the grandiose of Luxury Boutique's golden age was in sight once again, only through a screen, this time.
